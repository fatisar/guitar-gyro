CLASSES

Fretboard
 * Models the notes on a fretboard
 * Maps notes to 2-tuples (i.e. fretted-positions): <string, fret>
   - A note can be played in multiple positions; returns all possible positions
 * Calculates distance between fretted-positions using the following encoding: <up, across>
   - 'up' is a +/- measure of how many strings separate the two positions
   - 'across' is a +/- measure of how many frets separate the two positions

Hand
* A generic class to represent a hand
- LeftHand
  * Maintains state for each of the four fret-able fingers on left hand
  * Implicitly (?) maintains hand-position (i.e. where is the first finger (index finger) on the fretboard)
    - Any advantage in explicitly maintaining this?
  * Array of four 3-tuples (i.e. finger-positions) : <string, fret, finger>
  * Computes difficulty-metric between finger-positions
    - 'Difficulty-metric' is a subjective measure of how difficult it is to move between two finger-positions
- RightHand
  * Maintains state for each of the five pick-able fingers on right hand
  * Array of five 2-tuples: <string, finger>

Reader
* Reads input file
  - Currently, EasyABC seems to be the best solution
  - Input format: MusicXML
  - Output format: abc
